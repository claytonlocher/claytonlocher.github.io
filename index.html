        <p>For the past couple of months, I've been working very closely with my client to bring his vision for a unique culinary website to life. Although still in development, this project is an ongoing learning experience and a great opportunity to apply my skills in the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>UI/UX design</li>
          <li>MVC architecture</li>
          <li>Custom CMS development</li>
          <li>Code scalability and maintainability</li>
          <li>Client-side optimization</li>
          <li>Workflow automation and version control</li>
          <li>SEO</li>
          <li>Brand development and design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Initially, a client-side JavaScript MV* framework such as Angular or React might have been a great fit, due to the high level of desired user interactivity. However, I realized rendering the pages on the client would limit the visibility of content in search engines and on social media, both important factors for the success of the consumer-oriented website. Therefore, I decided to develop the application using my favorite server-side platform and framework, Node.js and Express.</p>
          
        <p>Also, the flexibility and developer-friendly nature of using a cloud NoSQL database lead me to choose Firebase for housing the site's data. The Express application talks to Firebase through its Node.js API, fetches the dynamic content, and then renders the page on the server and sends it back to the client.</p>

        <p>This portfolio website for an accomplished creative and recent college graduate was a refreshing project to both design and develop. I decided to use plain, old HTML and CSS instead of Jade and Sass (my usual go-to "client-side" development tools) because the website owner already had some knowledge of HTML and CSS and would need to easily edit the site over time. To limit the redundancy in markup and also introduce a single-page application (SPA) feel without page reloads, I decided to use AJAX with jQuery to simply load each "page" as a snippet of HTML to be placed in the main content area.</p>

        <p>The portfolio itself is heavily focused on visual elements, leading to some challenges with responsive images and page performance. Therefore, I took care in optimizing thumbnails and taking advantage of preloading images with a lightbox jQuery plugin.</p>

        <p>I was excited to take on the challenge of developing a custom website for a new non-profit organization that I joined as a founding team member. The team wanted a clean, friendly website that would inform visitors of the organization's mission and encourage donations of e-readers to be redistributed to children in need of educational resources.</p>

        <p>I first worked alongside the team in researching topics like search engine optimization (SEO), calls to action (CTA), and digital marketing strategies. I then carried out designing and developing the first iterations of the website using custom CSS on top of Bootstrap, not having a great deal of experience with modern CSS layout techniques at the time. As the team grew in size, we improved some design elements and worked together to create and refine the site's content.</p>

        <p>The website was originally built as a server-side application with Node.js and Express, with expectations to build out a set of tools for the organization. However, after first setting up and deploying the site to a Linux server on DigitalOcean, I decided that a template-driven static site (using Jade/Pug) was a more appropriate solution for the needs of the team.</p>
